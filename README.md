### Hey there! 👋

I'm Vincent, an 18-year-old Industrial IT student passionate about software development, always looking to push the boundaries of creativity and tech. From web development to game design, I love working on diverse projects that challenge me to grow and learn.

#### 🛠️ Projects
- **[Learning Platform](#)**: A personal web app built with Vue.js and Node.js, designed to help me learn French through flashcards and PDF/book management.
- **MarketSoft**: A comprehensive market software for product sales (discontinued).
- **[Escape From Exile](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2482140/Escape_From_Exile/)**: My first survival game release on Steam, built in Unity and C#.
- **[Pterodactyl Market](#)**: A standalone website that attracted over 20k users for selling Pterodactyl add-ons and themes (discontinued).
- **MyNode Panel**: A custom hosting panel solution with VPS integration, spun off from the Pterodactyl panel to streamline server management.
- **[My Personal Website](https://vincentvanhoof.be/)**: Dive deeper into my projects and get to know me better.

🔭 **Currently exploring** cutting-edge tech and refining my skill set through hands-on projects.
