### Hey there! 👋

I'm Vincent, an 18-year-old Industrial IT student passionate about software development. From web development to game design, I love working on diverse projects.

#### 🛠️ Projects
- **[Learning Platform]([#](https://learningplatform.vincentvanhoof.be/))**: A personal web app built with Vue.js and Node.js, designed to help me learn French through flashcards and PDF/book management.
- **[Escape From Exile](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2482140/Escape_From_Exile/)**: My first survival game release on Steam, built in Unity and C#.
- **[Pterodactyl Market](#)**: A standalone website that attracted over 20k users for selling Pterodactyl add-ons and themes (discontinued).
- **[My Personal Website](https://vincentvanhoof.be/)**: Dive deeper into my projects and get to know me better.
- **[MarketSoft]([#](http://marketsoft.vincentvanhoof.be/))**: A comprehensive market software for product sales (discontinued).
- **[MyNode Panel](#)**: A custom hosting panel solution with VPS integration, spun off from the Pterodactyl panel to streamline server management.

🔭 **Currently exploring**, low level code and frameworks for web design.
